/*
In the above code:

The variable n shows the total number of prime numbers.

The first if statement specifies that the value of n shouldnâ€™t be less than 1.

We create an array of n values (i.e., Array(n)). The syntax Array(n).fill(2) is used to create an array of n elements, each having a value of 2.

We use two nested while loops.

The outer loop counts the number of generated prime numbers.

The inner loop keeps generating sequential integers until the next prime number is found.

We use the following variables:

n stores the total number of prime numbers.

p stores the generated prime numbers.

pcount keeps track of the most recently generated prime number.

v stores the next number to be tested.

i iterates through the array of prime numbers generated so far.

pflag indicates whether the current number is prime.

The comments in the program itself will help explain the rest of the code.
