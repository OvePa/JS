Arithmetic sequence
An arithmetic sequence is an ordered set of numbers that have a common difference between each consecutive term.

Write a program that shows the first five terms of the arithmetic sequence 0,5,10,15,20.

Harmonic sequence
A harmonic sequence is an ordered set of numbers that have a common difference between the reciprocals of each consecutive term.

Write a program that shows the first five terms of the harmonic sequence 1/2,1/4,1/6,1/8,1/10.

Geometric sequence
A geometric sequence is an ordered set of numbers that have a common multiplier between each consecutive term.

Write a program that shows the first five terms of the geometric sequence 1,3,9,27,81.
